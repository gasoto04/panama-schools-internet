In a rare interview he described how rebels had recently plotted a seaborne assault on his palace in the current capital, Malabo. 'We need a secure place for my government and for future governments. That's why we have created Oyala, to guarantee the government of Equatorial Guinea.' [@sackur_equatorial_2012]\n\nThis case is far from exceptional, as an even more recent *Washington Post* article points out with respect to Myanmar's decision to move its capital from Yangon to Naypyidaw:\n\n> Analysts have described the decision as motivated by a desire to secure the military’s seat of power from any threat of protests or invasions. [@berger_myanmars_2021]\n\nMost of these studies, however, are based on observations of **conflict events**. In this study, we study the more fundamental variable of a capital's distance from the **population centroid** of the country.\n\n## Literature Review\n\n@campante_capital_2019 analyzes the relationship between the location of a **capital city** and the degree of conflict and misgovernance in a given country. Their two key findings are that:\n\n> Conflict is more likely to emerge (and dislodge incumbents) closer to the capital\n\nand\n\n> Isolated capitals are associated with misgovernance.\n\nThis first finding is illustrated in @fig-conflict-dist\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\nBelow we display two tables for both ** Districts and at the Province level ** showing relevant indicators such as:\n- Numbers of schools\n- Numbers of Access Points\n- Population\n- Access Points per School Ratio\n- Access Points per 1000 people Ratio\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-pdf/exploratoy-data-analysis-1.pdf)\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-pdf/exploratoy-data-analysis-2.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br>\nWe can see from the above tables, that Districts that house cities, are the ones with higher amounts of access points. We see the same behavior with the Provinces, specially with main cities such as Panama, Veraguas and Chiriqui. \n<br>\nMost of these studies, however, are based on observations of **conflict events**.

Adding schools improves the model's explanatory power (R² increased by 2.6%). Both population and schools are significant predictors as we can see in the below tables. We can see that for each additional school, we expect 0.216 more access points, holding population constant\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\begin{talltblr}[         %% tabularray outer open\ncaption={Regression Results: Access Points, Population, and Schools},\nnote{}={+ p \\num{< 0.1}, * p \\num{< 0.05}, ** p \\num{< 0.01}, *** p \\num{< 0.001}},\n]                     %% tabularray outer close\n{                     %% tabularray inner open\ncolspec={Q[]Q[]Q[]},\ncolumn{2,3}={}{halign=c,},\ncolumn{1}={}{halign=l,},\nhline{8}={1,2,3}{solid, black, 0.05em},\n}                     %% tabularray inner close\n\\toprule\n& Model 1 & Model 2 \\\\ \\midrule %% TinyTableHeader\nIntercept  & \\num{4.874}*** & \\num{-2.568}   \\\\\n& (\\num{1.302})  & (\\num{1.772})  \\\\\nPopulation & \\num{0.000}*** & \\num{0.000}*** \\\\\n& (\\num{0.000})  & (\\num{0.000})  \\\\\nSchools    &                 & \\num{0.216}*** \\\\\n&                 & (\\num{0.040})  \\\\\nNum.Obs.   & \\num{75}       & \\num{75}       \\\\\nR2         & \\num{0.909}    & \\num{0.935}    \\\\\nR2 Adj.    & \\num{0.907}    & \\num{0.933}    \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{talltblr}\n\\end{table}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n## Geospatial Analysis\n\n**Access Points Map**\n\nLet's explore how access points are distributed along the country. As validated above, the districts with the highest amount of access points are those located around Panama City (459 approx), Santiago with 198 and Boquete with approximately 118 access points. Interestingly we can detect that probably these clusters, do not follow a random location.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-pdf/access-points-map-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n<br>\n**Access Points Density per District Map**\n\nNow let's explore how different access points density is within districts. With this map we can confirm that the districts of David, Santiago, Colon and Panama are the ones with a higher concentration of access points. This makes sense in the context that, these districts are where we can locate higher economic development in the country.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-pdf/district-data-access-points-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\n**Panama Highway Map**\n\nHighways represent economic development, as they try to bridge different disitrcts across the country. Our hypothesis here is that, access points will be located, around districts where we can see an intersection with the Panamerican Highway. It is worth noting that this highway goes across the complete country form west to east, mostly located on the pacific side of the country, where Panama City is.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-pdf/panama-highway-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\n**Public Schools Map**\n\nThis map shows, clustered, every school in the country. There are 9 types of classifications on the school system:\n- COIF\n- Cefacei\n- IPHE\n- Kinder\n- Parvulario\n- Primaria Oficial\n- Privada\n- Secundaria\n- Universidad\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\n**Which Districts are Intersected by the Panamerican Highway?**\n\nBelow we find, which are the districts that intersect with the Panamerican Highway. As confirmed by the above analysis, the districts with the higher population densities and with the higher amount of access points installed, are more likely to be intersected by it. This is a causal effect of infrastructure development, as highways are more likely to be equiped with better structures to implement different services such as telecommunications.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\n## Moran's I\n\n**Access Points Moran's I**\n\nWe know that the scale runs from -1 (perfect dispersion) to +1 (perfect clustering). Our result is **0.229**, which indicates positive spatial correlation meaning that districts with similar number of access points (higher or lower) tend to cluster together. With our p-statistic, we can reject the null hypothesis of random spatial distribution. This means that access points are not positioned randomly but rather logically. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\n**Access Points vs Schools and Access Points vs Density Moran's I**\n\nWe know that the scale runs from -1 (perfect dispersion) to +1 (perfect clustering).
