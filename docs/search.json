Their two key findings are that:\n\nConflict is more likely to emerge (and dislodge incumbents) closer to the capital\n\nand\n\nIsolated capitals are associated with misgovernance.\n\nThis first finding is illustrated in ?@fig-conflict-dist"

    "text": "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\nBelow we display two tables for both ** Districts and at the Province level ** showing relevant indicators such as: - Numbers of schools - Numbers of Access Points - Population - Access Points per School Ratio - Access Points per 1000 people Ratio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We can see from the above tables, that Districts that house cities, are the ones with higher amounts of access points. We see the same behavior with the Provinces, specially with main cities such as Panama, Veraguas and Chiriqui.  Most of these studies, however, are based on observations of conflict events. In this study, we study the more fundamental variable of a capital’s distance from the population centroid of the country. \n ### Correlations between Population, Schools and Access Points\nBelow I show 2 plots, where on the left we see the relationship between Access points and Population and on the right, we see the relationship between Access Point-School ratio with the Population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = access_points ~ population, data = district_summary)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-41.413  -4.688  -2.250   3.524  34.859 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.
