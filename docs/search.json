    "text": "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\nBelow we display two tables for both ** Districts and at the Province level ** showing relevant indicators such as: - Numbers of schools - Numbers of Access Points - Population - Access Points per School Ratio - Access Points per 1000 people Ratio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We can see from the above tables, that Districts that house cities, are the ones with higher amounts of access points. We see the same behavior with the Provinces, specially with main cities such as Panama, Veraguas and Chiriqui.  Most of these studies, however, are based on observations of conflict events. In this study, we study the more fundamental variable of a capital’s distance from the population centroid of the country. \n Correlations between Population, Schools and Access Points\nBelow I show 2 plots, where on the left we see the relationship between Access points and Population and on the right, we see the relationship between Access Point-School ratio with the Population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Statistical Regression of Access Points on Population\nI have run 2 statistical regression models, where I regress Access Points on Population and Access Points both on Population and Schools. Adding schools improves the model’s explanatory power (R² increased by 2.6%). Both population and schools are significant predictors as we can see in the below tables. We can see that for each additional school, we expect 0.216 more access points, holding population constant\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    \n      \n        \n        Regression Results: Access Points, Population, and Schools\n              \n                 \n                Model 1\n                Model 2\n              \n        \n        + p &lt; 0.1, * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001\n        \n                \n                  Intercept \n                  4.874***\n                  -2.568  \n                \n                \n                            \n                  (1.302) \n                  (1.772) \n                \n                \n                  Population\n                  0.000***\n                  0.000***\n                \n                \n                            \n                  (0.000) \n                  (0.000) \n                \n                \n                  Schools   \n                          \n                  0.216***\n                \n                \n                            \n                          \n                  (0.040) \n                \n                \n                  Num.Obs.  \n                  75      \n                  75      \n                \n                \n                  R2        \n                  0.909   \n                  0.935   \n                \n                \n                  R2 Adj.   \n                  0.907   \n                  0.933"

    "text": "Geospatial Analysis\nAccess Points Map\nLet’s explore how access points are distributed along the country. As validated above, the districts with the highest amount of access points are those located around Panama City (459 approx), Santiago with 198 and Boquete with approximately 118 access points. Interestingly we can detect that probably these clusters, do not follow a random location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Access Points Density per District Map\nNow let’s explore how different access points density is within districts. With this map we can confirm that the districts of David, Santiago, Colon and Panama are the ones with a higher concentration of access points. This makes sense in the context that, these districts are where we can locate higher economic development in the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPanama Highway Map\nHighways represent economic development, as they try to bridge different disitrcts across the country. Our hypothesis here is that, access points will be located, around districts where we can see an intersection with the Panamerican Highway. It is worth noting that this highway goes across the complete country form west to east, mostly located on the pacific side of the country, where Panama City is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic Schools Map\nThis map shows, clustered, every school in the country. There are 9 types of classifications on the school system:\n\nCOIF\nCefacei\nIPHE\nKinder\nParvulario\nPrimaria Oficial\nPrivada\nSecundaria\nUniversidad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich Districts are Intersected by the Panamerican Highway?\nBelow we find, which are the districts that intersect with the Panamerican Highway. As confirmed by the above analysis, the districts with the higher population densities and with the higher amount of access points installed, are more likely to be intersected by it. This is a causal effect of infrastructure development, as highways are more likely to be equiped with better structures to implement different services such as telecommunications."

Our result is 0.229, which indicates positive spatial correlation meaning that districts with similar number of access points (higher or lower) tend to cluster together. With our p-statistic, we can reject the null hypothesis of random spatial distribution. This means that access points are not positioned randomly but rather logically.\n\n\n[1] \"Moran's I for Access Points vs Schools:\"\n\n\n\n    Moran I test under randomisation\n\ndata:  district_data_complete$access_points  \nweights: nb2listw(nb, style = \"W\", zero.policy = TRUE)  \nn reduced by no-neighbour observations  \n\nMoran I statistic standard deviate = 4.7929, p-value = 8.218e-07\nalternative hypothesis: greater\nsample estimates:\nMoran I statistic       Expectation          Variance \n      0.229408902      -0.013888889       0.002576752 \n\n\n\nMapping Access Points vs Schools ratio\nAs expected, we have a higher ratio within districts that are city districts such as Panama, San Miguelito, Pedasi and Chitre. It is worth mentioning that for instance, Pedasi is not a big city town, but instead is touristy town. They have 9 school total, with 11 AP located in this district."

When that threshold is passed, the clustering of these points decreases sharply. This is consonant to the logic of installing access points in dense areas and where more schools are located.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean nearest neighbor distance: 1617.98 meters\n\n\n\nMedian nearest neighbor distance: 400.99 meters\n\n\n\nBuffer Analysis with Panamerican Highway\nAs expected, from this analysis, we can see that there is a higher amount of schools outside the inner buffers, as schools will try to serve the wider population, beyond the urban areas. On the other hand, we will see more access points located in urban areas, therefore closer to the highway as they serve more the densed urban areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Zone Access_Points Schools AP_Percentage Schools_Percentage\n1       0-5 km         27937   29751       2140.77             919.94\n2      5-10 km         29707   46831       2276.40            1448.08\n3 Beyond 10 km        -56339  -73348      -4317.16           -2268.03\n  AP_per_School\n1          0.94\n2          0.63\n3          0.77\n\n\n\nAccess Points Distance from Panamerican Highway Analysis\nHere we analyze how far are the acces points from the highway and how clustered they are. Within the distribution, most access points are located within a 10km radius from the highway, meaning that they do follow a infrastructure logic behind the installation. It is very important to mention that there is an increase in the amount of access points beyond the 90/100kms. This follows the installation of access points in areas of difficult access, beyond the urban areas.\n\n\n[1] \"Summary statistics of distances (in km):\"\n\n\n     Min.   1st Qu.
