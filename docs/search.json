    "text": "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\nBelow we display two tables for both Districts and at the Province level showing relevant indicators such as: - Numbers of schools - Numbers of Access Points - Population - Access Points per School Ratio - Access Points per 1000 people Ratio\nThis is useful to compare, across the project, how more densed districts behave spatially.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see from the above tables, that Districts that house cities, are the ones with higher amounts of access points. We see the same behavior with the Provinces, specially with main cities such as Panama, Veraguas and Chiriqui.  Most of these studies, however, are based on observations of conflict events. In this study, we study the more fundamental variable of a capital’s distance from the population centroid of the country. \n\n\nCorrelations between Population, Schools and Access Points\nBelow I show 2 plots, where on the left we see the relationship between Access points and Population and on the right, we see the relationship between Access Point-School ratio with the Population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical Regression of Access Points on Population\nI have run 2 statistical regression models, where I regress Access Points on Population and Access Points both on Population and Schools. Adding schools improves the model’s explanatory power (R² increased by 2.6%). Both population and schools are significant predictors as we can see in the below tables. We can see that for each additional school, we expect 0.216 more access points, holding population constant.\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    \n      \n        \n        Regression Results: Access Points, Population, and Schools\n              \n                 \n                Model 1\n                Model 2\n              \n        \n        + p &lt; 0.1, * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001\n        \n                \n                  Intercept \n                  4.874***\n                  -2.568  \n                \n                \n                            \n                  (1.302) \n                  (1.772) \n                \n                \n                  Population\n                  0.000***\n                  0.000***\n                \n                \n                            \n                  (0.000) \n                  (0.000) \n                \n                \n                  Schools   \n                          \n                  0.216***\n                \n                \n                            \n                          \n                  (0.040) \n                \n                \n                  Num.Obs.  \n                  75      \n                  75      \n                \n                \n                  R2        \n                  0.909   \n                  0.935   \n                \n                \n                  R2 Adj.   \n                  0.907   \n                  0.933"

    "text": "Geospatial Analysis\n\nAccess Points Map\nLet’s explore how access points are distributed along the country. As validated above, the districts with the highest amount of access points are those located around Panama City (459 approx), Santiago with 198 and Boquete with approximately 118 access points. Interestingly we can detect that probably these clusters, do not follow a random location. I have clustered the access points data, to facilitate the readibility of the map. We can see the first signs that the spatial distribution follows a “S” layout, same as the country. This will be more clear later on, when we display other points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess Points Density per District Map\nNow let’s explore how different access points density is within districts. With this map we can confirm that the districts of David, Santiago, Colon and Panama are the ones with a higher concentration of access points. This makes sense in the context that, these districts are where we can locate higher economic development in the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPanama Highway Map\nHighways represent economic development, as they try to bridge different disitrcts across the country. Our hypothesis here is that, access points will be located, around districts where we can see an intersection with the Panamerican Highway. It is worth noting that this highway goes across the complete country form west to east, mostly located on the pacific side of the country, where Panama City is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic Schools Map\nThis map shows, clustered, every school in the country. There are 9 types of classifications on the school system:\n\nCOIF: Early Childhood Attention Center\nCefacei: Early Chilhood Community and Familiy Centers\nIPHE: Special Habilitation Panamanian Institute\nKinder: Pre Kinder\nParvulario: Kinder\nPrimaria Oficial: Elementary School\nPrivada: Private School\nSecundaria: Highschool\nUniversidad: College\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich Districts are Intersected by the Panamerican Highway?\nBelow we find, which are the districts that intersect with the Panamerican Highway. As confirmed by the above analysis, the districts with the higher population densities and with the higher amount of access points installed, are more likely to be intersected by it. This is a causal effect of infrastructure development, as highways are more likely to be equiped with better structures to implement different services such as telecommunications. As seen on the maps above, we can see that the districts with a higher concentration of access points, are the same ones that intersect with the highway."

    "text": "Moran’s I\n\n\nAccess Points Moran’s I\nWe know that the scale runs from -1 (perfect dispersion) to +1 (perfect clustering). Our result is 0.229, which indicates positive spatial correlation meaning that districts with similar number of access points (higher or lower) tend to cluster together. With our p-statistic, we can reject the null hypothesis of random spatial distribution. This means that access points are not positioned randomly but rather logically.\n\n\n[1] \"Moran's I for Access Points vs Schools:\"\n\n\n\n    Moran I test under randomisation\n\ndata:  district_data_complete$access_points  \nweights: nb2listw(nb, style = \"W\", zero.policy = TRUE)  \nn reduced by no-neighbour observations  \n\nMoran I statistic standard deviate = 4.7929, p-value = 8.218e-07\nalternative hypothesis: greater\nsample estimates:\nMoran I statistic       Expectation          Variance \n      0.229408902      -0.013888889       0.002576752 \n\n\n\n\n\nMapping Access Points vs Schools ratio\nAs expected, we have a higher ratio within districts that are city districts such as Panama, San Miguelito, Pedasi and Chitre. It is worth mentioning that for instance, Pedasi is not a big city town, but instead is touristy town. They have 9 school total, with 11 AP located in this district. In more urban areas we will have a higher ratio of access points to schools. This signals to a possibility of schools being located in highly densed areas and therefore, finding more access points."

    "text": "Pairwise Intensity function\nAnalyzing Intensity function\nAs expected, we see that access points tend to cluster together within distances of 1500 meters. When that threshold is passed, the clustering of these points decreases sharply. This is consonant to the logic of installing access points in dense areas and where more schools are located. The Mean nearest neighbor distance is 1617.98 meters. This means that we have some outliers access points, that are located in difficult access areas in very rural zones. They are more likely to be separeted from others. These locations could be pulling the mean up. On the other hand the Median nearest neighbor distance is 400.99 meters which is lower than the mean. This indicates that most of the access points are clustered in distances lower than 400 meters. This indicates a clustered pattern and not a uniform across the country. These are likely to be clustered in urban areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean nearest neighbor distance: 1617.98 meters\n\n\n\nMedian nearest neighbor distance: 400.99 meters\n\n\n\n\nBuffer Analysis with Panamerican Highway\nAs expected, from this analysis, we can see that there is a higher amount of schools outside the inner buffers, as schools will try to serve the wider population, beyond the urban areas. On the other hand, we will see more access points located in urban areas, therefore closer to the highway as they serve more the densed urban areas. Now if we analyze and see the amount of schools greater that 5km from the highway we see the number increaseing. This logically means that location of schools it is not as influenced by the highway as access points are. Schools follow a more uniformed pattern across the country, without clustering. This gives higher access to school to areas that are rural as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Zone Access_Points Schools AP_Percentage Schools_Percentage\n1       0-5 km         27937   29751       2140.77             919.94\n2      5-10 km         29707   46831       2276.40            1448.08\n3 Beyond 10 km        -56339  -73348      -4317.16           -2268.03\n  AP_per_School\n1          0.94\n2          0.63\n3          0.77\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess Points Distance from Panamerican Highway Analysis\nHere we analyze how far are the acces points from the highway and how clustered they are. Within the distribution, most access points are located within a 10km radius from the highway, meaning that they do follow a infrastructure logic behind the installation. It is very important to mention that there is an increase in the amount of access points beyond the 90/100kms. This follows the installation of access points in areas of difficult access, beyond the urban areas. From the results we see that the closest access point is located at 0.33kms from the highway. A quarter of the distribution of access points are within 1.55kms. Then, half of the access points are located within 8kms of distance from the highway. And 75% of the access points are within the 23kms mark. The furthest access point is located at 112.14kms from the highway, probably being a remote area or achipielago such as Bocas del Toro. This public data location data is a right-skewed distribution, where the tail of the distribution ends at the right. It’s a long tail stretch as these aps are not located in further areas, in comparison to those installed in urban areas.\n\n\n[1] \"Summary statistics of distances (in km):\"\n\n\n     Min.   1st Qu.

We can see, how schools are uniformly distributed across the country, trying to serve a greater size of the population. On the other hand, access points are clustered in urban areas, serving more densed general population instead of schools."

    "text": "Conclusion\nAccess to public internet through access points are highly related to urban areas, where we find higher densities. Now, this is not to say that rural areas do not have access to internet. They do and mostly through satellite installation of internet. We have to understand that Panama is a country with high inequalities and most of the development is done specific urban areas: Panama City, Chiriqui, Santiago and Colon. Population densities differ one to other greatly as job opportunities and infrastructure differ greatly between districts. This research offers a better visual to policy makers about where to enhance better access to internet, specially to public schools. Our analysis suggests that rural areas would benefit more with satellite access points intallations across the ports and costs of the Atlantic, which lacks a high number of aps compared to the Pacific side."
